# BasicProcessingProjects

These are a collection of the basic projects I created in Processing during my 9th grade CS course. 

Firework is a project where I used physics and some design to simulate the explosion of fireworks.

Rain was a simulation of the falling of raindrops and their subsequent accumulation on the ground. 

Barnsley Ferns uses the mathematical concepts behind the barnsley fern leaves to draw one entirely from dots. 

Basics Physics Demonstration has 3 components. The first is a simulation of an object that moves freely through space and time with no forces acted upon. The second introduces physics concepts such as inertia and gravity to make it realistic. The last is when the object simply “chases” the user’s mouse cursor without regard to physics. 

Clicker Hero is a personal take on the popular series of clicker games, but in this one you have to click in order to defeat a villain. 

Clock uses trigonometry and polar coordinates to create a “working” clock with moving hour and minute hands. 

Face uses geometric proportions to draw a face with lines and shapes. 

Fractal Tree uses math and recursion to draw a tree with an increasing number of branches. 

Phyllotaxis uses mathematical concepts and geometry to draw the inside of a flower through a series of dots, much like the Barnsley Ferns. 

Sierpski’s Triangle uses recursion to create a triangle divided into an infinite amount of triangles, which makes for a very cool illusion. 

Skyline Lab was a project where I used my creativity to draw a city skyline in Processing. This is more of an art-based project.
